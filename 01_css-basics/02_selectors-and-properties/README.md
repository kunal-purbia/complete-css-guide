# Selectors and Properties

- **Selectors** are used to target HTML elements you want to style.
- **Properties** define how the selected elements should be styled.

## Common Selectors:

- `Element selector` — targets all elements of a specific type.
- `.class selector` — targets elements with a specific class.
- `#id selector` — targets an element with a specific ID.
