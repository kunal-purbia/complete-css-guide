# Real-World Positioning Example

In this project, we combine **Sticky**, **Relative**, **Absolute**, and **Fixed** positioning to build a basic webpage layout.

---

## Layout Overview:

- **Sticky Header**:

  - Remains at the top while scrolling.

- **Hero Banner**:

  - Uses **relative positioning** to position a call-to-action (CTA) button absolutely within it.

- **Content Section**:

  - Standard scrollable content.

- **Fixed "Help" Button**:
  - Always visible at the bottom-right corner.

## Key Concepts Used:

| Feature        | Positioning Used                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Header         | Sticky                               |
| CTA Button     | Absolute inside a Relative container |
| Help Button    | Fixed                                |
| Banner Content | Relative                             |

---

## Quick Explanation:

- Sticky header improves UX by keeping navigation/actions accessible.
- Relative + Absolute allow precise positioning within a container.
- Fixed elements ensure important actions are always visible.
